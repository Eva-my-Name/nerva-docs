## Contributing
All you need to help us write the docs is a basic knowledge of the Markdown formatting language, which is easy to learn. To contribute you'll need to fork this repository, make your desired changes and then submit a pull request to merge those changes. If you aren't familiar with this process, feel free to ask for help on Discord: https://discord.gg/xBHxnGN

Changes may not immediately appear on the website, as the docs must first be rebuilt (into HTML) via mkdocs. This is currently done manually by syzygy.
