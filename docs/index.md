# Index
The documentation here is not exhaustive; the main focus of these pages is providing easy to follow tutorials, and helping users resolve common problems. Some additional developer-oriented documentaton is available [on BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/snippets/nerva-project/), and in the README files of individual repositories.

If you can't find what you need with the search function, help is always available on [Discord](https://discord.gg/xBHxnGN) or [Telegram](https://t.me/NervaXNV).

## Getting started with NERVA
If you're new to the project, then first of all, welcome! You've made the decision to be part of a cryptocurrency that aims to change the mindset of the crypto community and the evolution of cryptonote based coins. Taking the power back from big pools and GPU rigs and giving it back to the people. Where anyone with a computer and some time can mine coins. Truly decentralized and forever ASIC and GPU resistant. This is a small, yet ambitious project and your help and support really means a lot to the developers and community.

NERVA has both a graphical interface (GUI) and a command-line interface, with the CLI being generally preferred as it has more features and stability. However, both options are supported and guides are available for each. Here's what you might be looking for:

* [More information about Nerva](about/)
* [NERVA CLI Guide](guides/cli/) (with common issues & FAQ)
* [NERVA GUI Quick Guide](guides/gui/)

## How to contribute
The Nerva documentation is written and maintained by the community, and you can contribute too! To submit changes or new pages, refer to [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/mrsyzygy/nerva-docs) for a brief contributor's guide.

If you'd like to volunteer to help the Nerva project in another way - as a developer, or a graphic designer, or something completely different - join us on Discord to see where your talents may be useful. NERVA is all about the community and the more it grows, the stronger we will be.
