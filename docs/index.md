# NERVA Documentation
The documentation here is not exhaustive; the main focus of these pages is providing easy to follow tutorials, and helping users resolve common problems. Some additional developer-oriented documentaton is available [on BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/snippets/nerva-project/), and in the README files of individual repositories.

NERVA has both a graphical interface (GUI) and a command-line interface, with the CLI being generally preferred as it has more features and stability. However, both options are supported and guides are available for each. Here's what you might be looking for:

* [More information about NERVA](about/)
* [NERVA CLI Guide](guides/cli/) (with common issues & FAQ)
* [NERVA GUI Quick Guide](guides/gui/)
* [Ledger Hardware Wallet Guide](guides/ledger/)
* [Mining FAQ](guides/mining/)
* [A list of community projects](projects/)

If you can't find what you need with the search function, help is always available on [Discord](https://discord.gg/jsdbEns).
